# GAME-FEATURE-ANALYSIS
In recent years, online communities have become increasingly popular in the gaming sector. This report evaluates one such feature of KyngaCell's. The new online community feature was introduced by them in one of their games. The study focuses on user revenue, retention, and customer lifetime value (CLV) by employing techniques like Difference-in-Differences and regression models. The analysis utilizes data on players' in-game spending before and after the community launch, their joining age, churn status, average spend within 90 days, and user acquisition channels. Results reveal that joining the online community significantly boosts user revenue but also increases the likelihood of churn, resulting in no significant difference in CLV between community and non-community members. Furthermore, users who organically found the game generate higher revenue than those influenced by marketing campaigns. The decision to maintain the online community should align with the company's current priorities: if revenue growth is the focus, the community proves valuable; otherwise, if retention is the goal, keeping the online community active may not be recommended.
